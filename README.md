# Creative Engineering

This repository contains code I wrote for the monthly.com Creative Engineering class by Mark Rober.

# Project 2 (p2)

Arduino code for the "Living LED" art display. There's experimental code for controlling the various sensors (photoresistor, sonar rangefinder, temperature sensor) and the LEDs. Then there's several revisions of the final code that brings it all together.

# Project 3 (p3)

Python code for the Raspberry Pi "Shake-a-leg-alizer" project. Contains code to:
* Play an audio file using pygame
* Display a UI window using Tkinter
* Download Google Calendar information using the gcal API
